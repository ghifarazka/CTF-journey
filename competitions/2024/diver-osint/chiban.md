we can use google lens to get the exact store branch (sundi futaba branch): [https://www.sundi.co.jp/shop/details-futaba.html](https://www.sundi.co.jp/shop/details-futaba.html)&#x20;

Find a way to search for chiban in google. I googled "地番を検索” meaning "search chiban" and get this website: [https://chiban-kensaku.com/](https://chiban-kensaku.com/), Find the store "サンディ双葉町" in the website, then click on the road to get the chiban&#x20;
