# Day 21 - Sing my Song



Question: In which city did the song inspire the thief to go next?

### Solution

We are given a snippet of The Thief's post and an audio file. Since the song inspired The Thief, we might want to look at the lyrics. We can use an audio transcriber tool to get the lyrics.



From the lyrics, we get "Caribbean" and "The Mayans gave me a name" which means that the city could be in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. "Surrounded by clear waters" and "endless soft sand" means that it's a coastal city. "You love the sunrise" means that the beaches are facing east (can't be in Guatemala or El Salvador). "I am famous for my climate and my turquoise blue sea" means that the city is famous, probably a hot tourist spot. The city that matches these description the most is Cancun, Mexico.

As the song also said "Very close I have pyramids", Cancun is also known for being close to the famous Mayan pyramid, Chichen-Itza.
